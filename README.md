Description:
This is my Software Engineering project.

Approach:

//clone github repo - get URL from the repo mainpage.
$ git clone <URL>

//run docker-compose as daemon
$ docker-compose up -d

//go to your favorit webbrowser and write:
http://localhost:8080

//on mac you might need to write 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost - allthough i'm not entirely sure.
